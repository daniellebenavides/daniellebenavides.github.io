            <hr class="solid">

            <p>Howdy! I am a graduate of the Texas A & M University Class of 2020. I graduated Magna Cum Laude, with a bachelor in Environmental Design and a Minor in Art in the College of Architecture. I am currently pursuing my Master's in Science of Visualization at Texas A & M University with a strong focus on 3D Modeling, Look Development, Surfacing, and Texturing, as well as Concept Art, Character Design, and Storyboarding.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Much of my dedication has always been towards my studies and striving to improve my creativity and artistic nature. I am a person who desires to bring life into creative pieces and seeks to inspire others as many have come to inspire me. I constantly seek ways to improve myself and build up my confidence. Thus, this portfolio is full of creative pieces, academic and personal, that I hope to continue to build through my professional career.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I am constantly seeking personal improvement to better my knowledge in the creative realm and build my artistic style. I seek to work with others to reach a common goal, building friendships, and connections with each person I meet. Moving forward, I am eager to assist in bringing life to the creative realm of digital media and design; offering up my skills and leaving a lasting mark on others.</p>
