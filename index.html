        <div class="container">

            <p>Howdy! I am a graduate of Texas A & M University, Class of 2020. I graduated Magna Cum Laude, with a Bachelors in Environmental Design and a Minor in Art in the College of Architecture. I am currently pursuing my Master's in Science of Visualization with a strong focus on 3D Modeling, Look Development, Surfacing, and Texturing; as well as Concept Art, Character Design, and Storyboarding.</p>
            <p>I am constantly seeking personal improvement to better my    knowledge in the creative realm and build my artistic style. I seek to work with others to reach a common goal, building friendships, and connections with each person I meet. Moving forward, I am eager to assist in bringing life to the creative realm of digital media and design; offering up my skills and leaving a lasting mark on others.</p>
            <p>I truly enjoy drawing, writing, listening to music for inspiration for my personal stories, I love reading manga series, and losing myself inside my imaginations.</p>

        <h3>If you could domesticate any animal to have as a pet what would it be?</h3>
        <p>If I could domesticate any animal I would love it to be a wolf. My love for them is so grand since I could remember and I have always wanted to pet one or have the chance to meet one.</p>
